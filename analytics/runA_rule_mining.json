{"rule_mining": "Rules were defined for each design as a certain range of each type of chiplet. The ranges are as follows:\nnum = 0 (none), \n1 <= num <= 2 (low), \n3 <= num <= 5 (medium), \n6 <= num <= 8 (high), \nnum >= 9 (very high)\n\nThe prevelance of these rules were compared to the first three ranks of the pareto front. Given is the best combinations of rules which have high conf(f->p) (which is the confidence that a combination of rules implies being in the first three ranks of the pareto front) and conf(p->f) (which is the confidence that being on the pareto front implies a combination of rules). Also included is the lift, which is a ratio of how often the rule combination and the pareto front coincide to how often they would if they were independant.\n\n", "structured_rules": [{"rule": "GPU=high", "conf_f_to_p": 0.0732484076433121, "conf_p_to_f": 0.08041958041958042, "lift": 1.2}, {"rule": "GPU=low", "conf_f_to_p": 0.39490445859872614, "conf_p_to_f": 0.43356643356643354, "lift": 0.9}, {"rule": "Attention=high", "conf_f_to_p": 0.18152866242038215, "conf_p_to_f": 0.18627450980392157, "lift": 1.1}, {"rule": "Attention=medium", "conf_f_to_p": 0.5, "conf_p_to_f": 0.4, "lift": 0.8}, {"rule": "Sparse=high", "conf_f_to_p": 0.18789808917197454, "conf_p_to_f": 0.19093851132686085, "lift": 1.0}, {"rule": "Convolution=low", "conf_f_to_p": 0.40445859872611467, "conf_p_to_f": 0.4, "lift": 0.9}]}
