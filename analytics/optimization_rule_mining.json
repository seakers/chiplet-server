{"rule_mining": "Rules were defined for each design as a certain range of each type of chiplet. The ranges are as follows:\nnum = 0 (none), \n1 <= num <= 2 (low), \n3 <= num <= 5 (medium), \n6 <= num <= 8 (high), \nnum >= 9 (very high)\n\nThe prevelance of these rules were compared to the first three ranks of the pareto front. Given is the best combinations of rules which have high conf(f->p) (which is the confidence that a combination of rules implies being in the first three ranks of the pareto front) and conf(p->f) (which is the confidence that being on the pareto front implies a combination of rules). Also included is the lift, which is a ratio of how often the rule combination and the pareto front coincide to how often they would if they were independant.\n\nRule: Convolution_none, conf(f->p): 0.6842105263157895, conf(p->f): 0.48148148148148145, lift: [1.29239766]\n\nRule: GPU_low, conf(f->p): 0.631578947368421, conf(p->f): 0.6, lift: [1.61052632]\n\nRule: Sparse_high, conf(f->p): 0.5789473684210527, conf(p->f): 0.6111111111111112, lift: [1.64035088]\n\nRule: Convolution_none AND GPU_none, conf(f->p): 0.2631578947368421, conf(p->f): 1.0, lift: [2.68421053]\n\nRule: Convolution_none AND GPU_low, conf(f->p): 0.42105263157894735, conf(p->f): 0.8, lift: [2.14736842]\n\nRule: Attention_medium AND Sparse_high, conf(f->p): 0.47368421052631576, conf(p->f): 0.6923076923076923, lift: [1.8582996]\n\n"}
