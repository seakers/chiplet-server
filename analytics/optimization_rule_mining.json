{"rule_mining": "Rules were defined for each design as a certain range of each type of chiplet. The ranges are as follows:\nnum = 0 (none), \n1 <= num <= 2 (low), \n3 <= num <= 5 (medium), \n6 <= num <= 8 (high), \nnum >= 9 (very high)\n\nThe prevelance of these rules were compared to the first three ranks of the pareto front. Given is the best combinations of rules which have high conf(f->p) (which is the confidence that a combination of rules implies being in the first three ranks of the pareto front) and conf(p->f) (which is the confidence that being on the pareto front implies a combination of rules). Also included is the lift, which is a ratio of how often the rule combination and the pareto front coincide to how often they would if they were independant.\n\nRule: GPU_low, conf(f->p): 0.8181818181818182, conf(p->f): 0.8181818181818182, lift: [1.33884298]\n\nRule: GPU_low AND Convolution_none, conf(f->p): 0.6363636363636364, conf(p->f): 1.0, lift: [1.63636364]\n\n"}
